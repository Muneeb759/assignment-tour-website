<h2 id="Sapat Beach">Sapat Beach </h2>

<p>
    It is located about 220 km from Karachi at Lasbela district, Balochistan, Pakistan. 
    The beach is home to a curious rock formation called Bujih Koh â€” a steep cliff rising 
    from the sand entirely on its own. It's separated from the cliff wall that stretches 
    along the coast straddling the beach between its rocky embrace and the sea. The entire 
    beach is home to a healthy colony of crabs. Another interesting feature about this beach 
    is that there are some caves on the cliffs. The beach is an entirely different entity at 
    night. On full-moon nights, when the rays strike the surf of the incoming waves, they 
    almost seem to glow.

<p>
    The Princess of Hope is a natural rock formation in Pakistan of the type known as a hoodoo 
    or "fairy chimney" and which could fancifully be construed as resembling a crowned and 
    skirted female figure looking toward the horizon. It is situated approximately 190 km 
    (120 mi) from the financial hub of Karachi, Pakistan and approximately 717 km (446 mi) 
    from the provincial capital, Quetta.
