        <p >The Balochistan region is split between three countries: Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan. Administratively it comprises the Pakistani province of Balochistan, the Iranian province of Sistan and Baluchestan, and the southern areas of Afghanistan, which include Nimruz, Helmand and Kandahar provinces. It borders the Pashtunistan region to the north, Sindh and Punjab to the east, and Iranian regions to the west. Its southern coastline, including the Makran Coast, is washed by the Arabian Sea, in particular by its western part, the Gulf of Oman

            kilometers (93 mi) from Zero-Point on Makran Coastal Highway. It is located 236.8 
            kilometers (147.1 mi) west of Karachi, the largest city in Pakistan. The drive between

        <p class="p1">
        It is located about 220 km from Karachi at Lasbela district, Balochistan, Pakistan. 
        The beach is home to a curious rock formation called Bujih Koh â€” a steep cliff rising 
        from the sand entirely on its own. It's separated from the cliff wall that stretches 
        along the coast straddling the beach between its rocky embrace and the sea. The entire 
        beach is home to a healthy colony of crabs. Another interesting feature about this beach 
        is that there are some caves on the cliffs. The beach is an entirely different entity at 
        night. On full-moon nights, when the rays strike the surf of the incoming waves, they 
        almost seem to glow.

            The Princess of Hope is a natural rock formation in Pakistan of the type known as a hoodoo 
            or "fairy chimney" and which could fancifully be construed as resembling a crowned and 
            skirted female figure looking toward the horizon. It is situated approximately 190 km 
            (120 mi) from the financial hub of Karachi, Pakistan and approximately 717 km (446 mi)
